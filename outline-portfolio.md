I'm Anh Nguyen Hoang, and I am currently reasearch in AI for Software Development (AI4Code, AI4Software) advised by Prof [Bach Le](https://xuanbachle.github.io/) at FPT Software AI Center. I'd got exellent Bachelor's degree of Computer Science in Hanoi University of Science and Technology after 3.5 out of 4 years.

I currently focuses on developing algorithms to train and fine-tune Large Language Models for code and explore agentic system in terms of Software Engineer tasks. Additionally, I have experience on Continual Learning with 2 accepted top-tier publications:
* Preserving generalization of language models in few-shot continual relation extraction
    Quyen Tran*, Nguyen Xuan Thanh*, Nguyen Hoang Anh*, Nam Le Hai, Trung Le, Linh Van Ngo, Thien Huu Nguyen
    EMNLP 2024
* Mutual-pairing Data Augmentation for Fewshot Continual Relation Extraction
    Nguyen Hoang Anh*, Quyen Tran*, Thanh Xuan Nguyen*, Nguyen Thi Ngoc Diep, Linh Ngo Van, Thien Huu Nguyen, Trung Le
    NAACL 2025

I am also open to diversifying my research to various aspects in the future.

As a AI Researcher, I passionate to contribute not only the publications but also helpful open source repositories:
* [XTTSv2-Finetuning-for-New-Languages](https://github.com/anhnh2002/XTTSv2-Finetuning-for-New-Languages) 
    Repository for fine-tuning XTTSv2 (speech synthesizer model) on new languages by extending vocabulary and modifying code in the original Coqui AI TTS project.
* [vnhtr](https://github.com/anhnh2002/vnhtr)
    Pioneered one of the first attempts to tackle Vietnamese Handwritten Text Recognition, building upon TrOCR with an integrated Rethinking Head on top of the decoder module to adapt and optimize the baseline for the Vietnamese language.

I am actively seeking PhD positions in Computer Science for the upcoming academic year and am excited to contribute to innovative research and advancements in the field.
