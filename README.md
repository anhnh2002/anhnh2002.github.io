## About Me

I'm Anh Nguyen Hoang, currently conducting research in **AI for Software Development** (AI4Code, AI4Software) under the guidance of [Prof. Bach Le](https://xuanbachle.github.io/) at **FPT Software AI Center**. I graduated with an excellent Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from **Hanoi University of Science and Technology** in 3.5 out of 4 years.

My research focuses on developing algorithms to train and fine-tune **Large Language Models for code** and exploring **agentic systems** for Software Engineering tasks. I'm passionate about bridging the gap between artificial intelligence and software development to create more efficient and intelligent development tools.

## Open Source Projects

### üéôÔ∏è [XTTSv2-Finetuning-for-New-Languages](https://github.com/anhnh2002/XTTSv2-Finetuning-for-New-Languages)
Repository for fine-tuning XTTSv2 (speech synthesizer model) on new languages by extending vocabulary and modifying code in the original Coqui AI TTS project.

**Key Features:**
- Extended vocabulary support for new languages
- Modified Coqui AI TTS codebase
- Comprehensive fine-tuning pipeline

### üìù [vnhtr](https://github.com/anhnh2002/vnhtr)
Pioneered one of the first attempts to tackle **Vietnamese Handwritten Text Recognition**, building upon TrOCR with an integrated Rethinking Head on top of the decoder module to adapt and optimize the baseline for the Vietnamese language.

**Key Features:**
- Vietnamese language adaptation
- TrOCR-based architecture
- Custom Rethinking Head integration
- Optimized for Vietnamese handwriting patterns
